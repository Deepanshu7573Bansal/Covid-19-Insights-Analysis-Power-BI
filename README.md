Covid-19 Insights Analysis is one of the most popular project ideas among individuals. The project aims to thoroughly overview the Covid-19 pandemic's essential parameters, the latest situation, and detailed country-level evaluations. 

## Visualization Tool:
Power BI[![github](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17016297/18839843/0e06a67a-83d2-11e6-993a-b35a182500e0.png)][1]

## Dataset:
country_wise_latest.csv

## Dataset Source:
Kaggle

## Project Idea:
This project can focus on create dashboard to analysis covid 19 dataset by key metrics such as the total number of cases (active, recovered, and deceased). Load the Covid-19 dataset into Power BI and filter it for relevant fields such as country, number of cases, recoveries, and deaths. You can then prepare the data by calculating key metrics like mortality rate, recovery rate, and active case count per country. 

## Follow these steps for the data visualization part:
1. Create slicer of the country/regions.
2. Create cards to show over all total number of cases, active cases, recovered cases, deaths in world or in any specific country.
3. Create map visualization to show the total cases.
4. Create multicard to show the number of country/regions in specific WHO region.
5. Create pie chart to show the total number of cases, active cases, recovered cases, deaths in world or in any specific country.
6. Create column chart to show top 6 country/region has highest total cases.
7. Create column chart to show low 6 country/region has lowest total cases(it means those 6 country which has lowest cases).

## Key Business Questions to Explore
1. How do case numbers differ across countries?
2. What are the recovery rates and mortality rates by region?
3. Which countries have successfully reduced case numbers?
4. How different countries managed facilities during pandemic(analyzed by total cases, active cases, recovered cases, deaths).
5. How much government focusing to health outcomes during pendamic?
